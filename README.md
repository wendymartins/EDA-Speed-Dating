# Speed Dating with Tinder

## Company's description

Tinder is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests. 

Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.


## Project

The marketing team experienced a decrease in the number of matches, and they tried to find a way to understand **what makes people interested into each other**. 

They decided to run a speed dating experiment:

Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.
The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.

## Our Goal

**To try to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together.**
